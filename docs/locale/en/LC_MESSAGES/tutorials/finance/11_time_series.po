"Across many problems in finance, one starts with time series. Here, we "
"showcase how to generate pseudo-random time-series, download actual "
"stock-market time series from a number of common providers, and how to "
"compute time-series similarity measures."

"Once the data are loaded, you can run a variety of algorithms on those to"
" aggregate the data. Notably, you can compute the covariance matrix or a "
"variant, which would consider alternative time-series similarity measures"
" based on dynamic time warping (DTW). In DTW, changes that vary in speed,"
" e.g., one stock's price following another stock's price with a small "
"delay, can be accommodated."
